                <p style="padding-left:5px;">Bemygenie allows the host to register a wishlist for the event. The host then goes on to search and add products which he/she desires to receive as gifts and add them to the wishlist one by one.
                Once the wishlist is created, the host will be provided with a secure link (URL) which he/she can then share with the invitees.<br><br>The invitees will be able to access the wishlist through the URL and purchase the gists they would like to give. The gift
                purchased, is directly sent to the invitee by the seller. Check out our <a href="/howitworks.html">How it works</a> section.</p>

                <p style="color:#7a2b6a">How should I plan setting up a registry?</p>
                <p style="padding-left:5px;">It's always best to create your registry and share it with your guests a couple of weeks ahead of the speical occasion. This would give guests enough time to decide on what gifts to get you, purchase the item and have it delivered to them in time for your event.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">
                <p style="color:#7a2b6a">Do you have any advice on how to set up a gift registry?</p>
                <p style="padding-left:5px;">Glad you asked, we are happy to help. Firstly, choose the gifts that you would love to get on your special occasion. Secondly, it's best to include gifts from all price ranges into your gift regsitry. Finally, add as many gifts as you can into your registry, so that your guests too have a choice on what to get you. For eg. if you are throwing a Birthday party, and invite 10 people, make sure you have a minimum of 12 gifts in your registry so that your guests will always have a choice.</p>
